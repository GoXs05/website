								<p>Hi, I'm Gokul Sriramasubramanian, currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science + Astronomy 
									at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.</p>
								<p>I've always been fascinated by the intricate connections between science and the world around us. 
									Whether it's making Rube Goldberg Machines, building sodium-powered cars, or creating various DIY projects around 
									my household, my passion for building and understanding how things work has been a central part of my life. My 
									exhilaration at using science to explain and manipulate the everyday world has always been a part of who I am. 
									The idea that science is everywhere is truly invigorating. But I’m not sure science can explain why I love building 
									so much.</p>
								<p>My journey into coding and technology has been equally exciting. It started with a childhood obsession with game 
									development, which soon led me to explore more advanced topics like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and 
									astrophysics. Along the way, I discovered how these disciplines could be intertwined, enhancing my projects and 
									revealing new possibilities. Through internships and independent study, I’ve continuously sought to push the 
									boundaries of my knowledge, applying my skills to real-world challenges like medical research and space exploration. 
									My goal is to keep building—both in the literal and metaphorical sense—and to find innovative ways to use technology 
									to unlock the mysteries of the universe.</p>
								<p>Music has been a central part of my life for as long as I can remember. I've been playing the Carnatic violin for the
									 past 11 years, starting under the guidance of my grandfather, Sri R. Kailasam, and later learning from the renowned
									 Delhi Sri P. Sunderrajan. Recently, I had the honor of performing my violin arangetram, a milestone that marked a
									 significant achievement in my musical journey.</p>
								<p>My passion for music extends beyond playing the violin. I've also been learning vocal Carnatic music for 13 years,
									 initially training with Srimathi Shubha Narayanan and later with Srimathi Indu Nagarajan and Sri Delhi P. Sunderrajan.
									 This vocal background has not only enriched my understanding of the art form but has also significantly enhanced my
									 Carnatic violin performances, allowing me to infuse greater depth and emotion into my playing.</p>
								<p>Alongside my Carnatic training, I've also been learning Western violin for the past decade, which has expanded my musical
									 horizons and allowed me to perform in numerous concerts as part of my high school chamber orchestra. </p>
								<p>In my free time, I enjoy composing orchestral and electronic/hybrid music, blending different musical styles to create
									 something uniquely my own. I’ve spent many years honing this skill as well, researching software, plugins, and virtual
									 instrument libraries, and their use in producing professional quality music. While my initial pieces were nowhere near
									 said threshold, I kept toiling away. Over the years, I learned about new libraries, techniques, and instruments. I fell
									 in love with composing music.</p>

								<p>Protocol XenoD is a story-based first person shooter, set in an distant future with endless technological marvels.
									Here's the <a href="https://github.com/GoXs05/Chimeraspace" target="_blank">Github repo!</a></p>
								<p>I am a solo developer who is responsible for game design, programming, storyline, artwork(2D & 3D), animation, music, and
									SFX/VFX. Currently, I'm working on a "practice range" map called Chimeraspace, which provides players with a practice area
									to test gunplay, movement, and abilities against enemies. The game runs on Unity as of now.</p>
								<p>I'm also currently learning Unreal Engine 5, and am planning to port this game to it soon. This will allow me to include 
									more realistic graphics and physics simulations, and will help the game's performance.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Habitability Of</br>Exoplanets With</br>NASA Data</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="Project 2 Icon" /></span>
								<p>This project focuses on using ML to analyze data from the NASA exoplanet archive and predict whether a given exoplanet will be 
									habitable for humans. By analyzing planetary features including (but not limited to) mass, radius, surface temperature, orbital 
									period, and planet type, the model predicts whether a given exoplanet may be habitable for humans. As the discovery of 
									exoplanets continues to grow exponentially, identifying exoplanets that could potentially support life is of great importance to 
									both astronomers and the broader scientific community.</p>
								<p>The search for habitable exoplanets has become one of the most exciting fields in astronomy. Astronomers estimate that there are 
									billions of planets in our galaxy alone, and among them, a small fraction may reside in the habitable zone, where conditions 
									could allow liquid water to exist, a key ingredient for life. However, the habitability of a planet depends on many other factors, 
									such as its atmospheric composition, stellar radiation, and geological features.</p>
								<p>While some research focuses on discovering planets with these characteristic, this project aims to go a step further by combining 
									machine learning with NASA's exoplanet data to predict a planet's habitability based on multiple variables. By using known 
									exoplanet data and characteristics of habitable planets in our solar system, we can create a model to assess habitability more 
									accurately than just relying on distance from the host star and/or whether the exoplanet is in the habitable zone of its host 
									star.</p>
								<p>As our knowledge of exoplanets grows, the ability to identify potentially habitable worlds becomes increasingly important for both 
									future exploration and the search for extraterrestrial life. This project not only provides a method for evaluating habitability 
									but also offers a foundation for future research, incorporating stellar activity and atmospherics into the prediction process. 
									This project aims to create a comprehensive model that can assist in prioritizing targets for future space missions and telescopic 
									observations.</p>
								<p>Here's the <a href="https://github.com/GoXs05/Habitable_Exoplanets" target="_blank">Github repo!</a> This project is still in progress, and updates 
									will be posted on Github!</p>
